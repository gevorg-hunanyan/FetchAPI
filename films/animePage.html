            echo with the endless bickering and intense debate between two inseparable best friends. Exuding unshakeable
            confidence, Satoru Gojou and Suguru Getou believe there is no challenge too great for young and powerful
            Special Grade sorcerers such as themselves. They are tasked with safely delivering a sensible girl named
            Riko Amanai to the entity whose existence is the very essence of the jujutsu world. However, the mission
            plunges them into an exhausting swirl of moral conflict that threatens to destroy the already feeble amity
            between sorcerers and ordinary humans.\n\nTwelve years later, students and sorcerers are the frontline
            defense against the rising number of high-level curses born from humans' negative emotions. As the entities
            grow in power, their self-awareness and ambition increase too. The curses unite for the common goal of
            eradicating humans and creating a world of only cursed energy users, led by a dangerous, ancient cursed
            spirit. To dispose of their greatest obstacle—the strongest sorcerer, Gojou—they orchestrate an attack at
            Shibuya Station on Halloween. Dividing into teams, the sorcerers enter the fight prepared to risk everything
            to protect the innocent and their own kind.</p>
